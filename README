# Number Game

## Description
This Number Game is a simple, fun, and interactive command-line application where players take turns to choose a number from 1 to 10. The goal is to reach a total score of 100 without going over. The game offers both single-player (against an AI) and two-player modes. In single-player mode, you can choose between Easy and Hard difficulties, where the Hard mode features an unbeatable AI.

This project was developed to demonstrate to my kids how a simple game they saw on YouTube could be translated into a real, playable code-based game. It's a great example of how programming can bring ideas to life and is perfect for teaching basic programming concepts and logic.

## Features
- **Two Modes of Play**: Choose between playing solo against the AI or with another player.
- **Difficulty Levels**: In single-player mode, choose between an Easy AI and a Hard AI.
- **Interactive CLI**: Simple and user-friendly command-line interface.

## How to Play
1. **Start the Game**: Run the game from the command line.
2. **Choose Mode**: Select between single-player and two-player modes.
   - In single-player mode, choose between Easy and Hard difficulties.
3. **Gameplay**:
   - Each player, in turn, chooses a number between 1 and 10.
   - The chosen number is added to the total score.
   - The player to make the total score reach 100 wins.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

## Running the Game
Execute the game from the command line with:
```bash
node index.js
```

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: For the backend logic and CLI interaction.
- **Jest**: For testing the game logic.

## About the Project
This project was a fun and educational experience aimed at showing my children how programming can turn simple ideas into interactive and enjoyable applications. It demonstrates the basics of game development, logic implementation, and user input handling.
